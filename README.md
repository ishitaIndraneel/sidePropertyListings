# Welcome to Side Product Listings Application

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Upon page load you will see a menu bar with a clickable link "Property Listings" 
I have created a menu bar to accomodate future routes. Please click the menu bar to navigate to the Property Listings page.

The Property Listings component fetches the listings and stores them in local storage. In the future new components can read the 
listings by accessing the local storage instead of making calls to the api
The properties can be selected by clicking on the heart icon. The selctions are saved into local storage.
